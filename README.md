# 📦 E-commerce Delivery Delay Prediction

This project was submitted as **Task 2** under the **CODTECH Data Analytics Internship**, focused on building regression models to predict delivery delays and optimize shipping performance.

## 🔍 Objective
To accurately predict whether an e-commerce delivery will be delayed based on customer behavior, order details, and shipping data.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔁 Workflow
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, ensured no nulls
- Feature Engineering: Derived variables to improve performance
- Visualizations: Histograms and heatmaps for trend analysis
- Model Building: Tested multiple regressors (Linear, RF, XGBoost)
- Best Accuracy: **99% with Random Forest**

## 📈 Outcome
Achieved extremely high model performance with strong correlation between delay and features like delivery time, product category, and shipping mode.
